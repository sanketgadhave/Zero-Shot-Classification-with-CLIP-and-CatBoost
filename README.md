# Zero-Shot-Classification-with-CLIP-and-CatBoost
Explored enhancing zero-shot classification by integrating OpenAI's CLIP model with CatBoost. While CLIP alone achieved a 90% F1 score on flower species, training CatBoost on CLIP's embeddings improved the F1 score to 95.9%. This approach leverages CLIP's embeddings to handle more specific classification tasks effectively.
